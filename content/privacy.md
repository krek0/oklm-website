The **connection** between your device and the server is **secure and encrypted**, thanks to HTTPS.

I **do not store any logs** of user activity on our servers.

Your **Vaultwarden** vault is **secure**. Even if I wanted to, I **cannot** access any Vaultwarden data.

I **will not** read your requests, monitor your actions, or keep logs of what you do.
However, here is a list of what I can **theoretically** access:
- For services like Whoogle, Redlib, Piped, Downloader, Stirling PDF, and ConvertX I can see what you do.
- I can access all your Nextcloud datas and Immich photos, so I recommend that you encrypt yourself data that you consider sensitive.

# Backups
I follow the [3-2-1](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/) backup strategy for the server, but I recommend you (at least for important data) do the same.
